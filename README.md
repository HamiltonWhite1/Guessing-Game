# Guessing-Game
This project was given to me as an assignment on day three of the second week of my coding bootcamp with Coding Temple. While we only needed to
design the game based on a series of general instructions, I chose to practice nesting functions to avoid more conditional statements, and 
to assist in my code's readability. This is an earlier project in my longer journey as a student, but I am proud of the progress it shows that I've made
in my understanding of these concepts.
